## Low-fidelity sketches
![L'image]("20250127_151837.jpg")

## List of taken considerations for sketches/design
I want the user to understand easily what to do at the beginning : that's why the only object you can interact with in the first page is the URL selector.
When the url is pasted, the image of a thumb up or down with a green or red background will tell if the deal is good or not.
I added a percentage of vertitude, so the user can evaluate the risks before going into the deal.

## Main problem we are solving for
Being able to check if reselling a lego set will be worth 

## Measures of the success
The biggets profit possible, calculated and shown by the thumb. 

## List of visual aspects convictions
I want the website tu have a very clean look. I haven't checked for fonts I like at the moment. 
The color will be important to show how good the deal and profit is.
The icons, boxes and buttons will be rounded.
For the layout, I want an inverted L section to be locked in place, and the rest will be a scrollable element.

## List of interaction patterns convictions
No breadcrumbs, as we won't need them.
The elemements in the scrollable list will either be a direct link to the vinted sale or a dedicated page with all the informations, with a link to the vinted sale.
For the colors, I'd like to use traditionnal lego colors : Red, Yellow and White.
